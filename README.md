Implemented real-time CAN Bus communication between an FPGA (Altera Cyclone IV) and an Arduino.
Data transffered through SPI Communication at baud rate of 50 kbps.This uses two MCP2515 CAN modules, one CAN module converts data from FPGA to CAN frames and second one converts CAN frames to CANH nad CANL and transmits to Arduino
Visualized the received data on an LCD, ensuring accurate real-time monitoring.
